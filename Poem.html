    <h1>The Moon and the Nightsky</h1>
    <p>- Hey... Did I ever tell you about the time the moon fell off the nightsky and he went looking for her?<br>
    - No... But please, tell me about it.<br>
    ...<br>
    - So, did he find her?<br>
    - Kind of. You see, the nightsky is... a lot of things. One of them found her, but when it was time to take her back she said<br>
    ...No...
